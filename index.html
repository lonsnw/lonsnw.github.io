      I'm an experienced content strategist, writer, and educator who has worked in the medical device, financial technology, and higher education industries. 
      I work well with and in teams, I like solving puzzles and making connections, and I'm constantly developing my technical skills.
      <br><br>
      This is a website that I built from scratch.  It uses HTML5 and CSS, and I built it using things I learned from online resources.
      <br><br>
      I will be participating in a coding boot camp program in order to expand my technical skillset (and eventually make much cooler websites if I want to).

<h1>README</h1>
This is the first multi-page website that I have ever built.

My resume page was built as part of an application to a bootcamp and has been updated only to change the content of my resume.  Even with the changes to the resume, the resume predates my start date for the bootcamp.

The rest of this website was built when I was doing prework for said bootcamp.

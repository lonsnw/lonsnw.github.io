<h3>This is a copy of the Personal questions and answers that I submitted for my Prime application.</h3>

<h2>Question 1</h2>
Why are you applying to Prime versus accessing free or inexpensive self-development options? What appeals to you about immersive learning?

> In this question, we want to understand how your preferred learning style aligns with Prime’s program.

<h3>Response:</h3>
At the risk of both dating and embarrassing myself, I'll say that I've been experimenting with tiny bits of coding since I was a kid trying to make my Xanga cooler than all of my friends'.  I've continued to use bits and pieces of code that I learn from free resources or from tinkering since then.  My most formal encounter so far with learning to code was in grad school, where I took a course that taught me how to mine and analyze literary texts using R.  This indirect relationship with coding has shown me two things: the first is that I find coding fascinating and the second is that I need a better foundation if I want to both remember what I'm doing and explore more possibilities.
<br>
I also have a long background in learning (I have a PhD in Media Studies) and in teaching (I taught writing and Media Studies for about 6 years).  I learn best when I've been able to discuss and I really value hearing different perspectives and understandings.  I know from experience that the best way for me to create a solid foundation for a new skill is to have learned it in the company and with the input of others.  I also know that I will need the structure of a program like Prime's to make sure that I keep progressing and don't get stuck, either because I need help or because life is busy.  I like alternating between immersive, collaborative learning and autonomous projects, so Prime seems like a perfect fit.

<h2>Question 2</h2>
Prime’s full-time programs require students to dedicate 60 hours or more per week to their studies. For part-time programs, students can expect to spend 20-25 hours per week. It’s common for students to spend a lot of time in front of their screens during class and while working on nightly and weekend homework. What work have you done to prepare for this challenge? What strategies will you utilize to persevere through this program?

> In this question, we’re looking to learn about skills you have developed to handle difficulty.

<h3>Response</h3>
I've got a lot of practice working long days and tackling large and/or complex tasks.  Grad school, teaching, and the jobs I've had since have been complicated and often very demanding on my time.  I like to structure work like this by breaking a project into small milestones and make both the project and the hours needed to complete it feel more manageable.
<br>
I have a really good home office set up to keep me comfortable at my desk.  I have a pretty solid routine for how to intersperse mental and physical breaks in order to keep myself relatively fresh and ready to learn and/or work.  If I get cabin fever in my office, there are other spaces in and around my home where I can work (and a portable monitor to save my eyes).  And my cat, Waffle, is always around for voluntary or involuntary snuggles as a brief screen break.

<h2>Question 3</h2>
While studying at Prime, you will be introduced to many challenging and exciting new technologies. Share a bit about your skills and experience as it relates to the tech industry. What web development or programming self-study have you completed thus far? What have you learned?

> In this question, we're looking to learn about your technical background and any work you've done independently to explore the field.

<h3>Response</h3>
I've worked in medtech and web3 since leaving academia.  When I was an academic and teaching, I regularly put together and presented multi-media presentations.  I like teaching myself how to use new tools and figuring out what I can build with them and especially what I can do with them to help or teach others.
<br>
Something that I worked on recently that piqued my interest in formalized learning about coding was a Proof of Concept (POC) that I did for my current job.  In an effort to convince my boss that we should move our documentation to BitBucket, I used Codecademy, Stack Overflow, and a couple of other online resources to teach myself enough CLI and Git to build out some sample documentation in BitBucket.  The POC included minor coding instructions on how to create the documentation, branch it, and merge it.  
<br>
I'm also currently working on a certification course for a CMS that I've used, and, as part of that, I will be learning how developers work with the CMS, especially with their API.  I won't learn the code itself, but I will learn about the role that web development plays in the workflow.  This won't be my first time learning about APIs--one of my jobs was to write help documentation about APIs, and that gave me an introduction to what they are and an idea of how they work.  That's not to say that I know how to use one... yet.
<br>
Essentially, my work has let me circle around coding to get an idea of what might be done with it, and I've taken the opportunities to learn a bit and incorporate it when that makes sense.

<h2>Question 4</h2>
Name a personal characteristic that you highly value in yourself. How does that characteristic allow you to collaborate meaningfully with others?

> In this question, we want to learn about how you approach problem solving, working with others, and how you might help create an inclusive environment at Prime.

<h3>Response</h3>
I find other people and the way they think about things to be interesting.  I like learning how others approach problems, how they organize information in their heads (and in their notes), and how that structures the way that they understand things.  This means that I like working with others to solve issues and that I like learning from people.  I'm also very practiced at research and like to learn from the experiences of others as much as from the people themselves.  I think a good solution is influenced by discussion, varied perspectives, research, and creativity.
<br>
Relatedly, I frequently enter into conversations and experiences without having decided where I need to end up.  I typically have a general idea and occasionally have a definite need, but it's not unusual for me to be influenced as I go.  I think that allowing input and being flexible are strengths, as long as flexibility is not the only goal.  But if you're trying to solve a problem with a team, you need to be able to hear about every facet of the problem and every need that folks want addressed in order to decide what the best solution is.

<h2>Question 5</h2>
Tech is a fast paced, ever changing field. At Prime, we seek to equip students with the skills they need to know now as well as the ability to adapt and learn new skills quickly. How would you seek to continue learning after Prime?

> In this question, we want to learn about your long-term goals in attending Prime. Are you interested in changing the culture of tech? Do you want to help mentor other self-starters? How do you want to contribute to the community?

<h3>Response</h3>
Right now, I work in content strategy and technical writing.  I think about the audiences for various pieces of technology and try to translate the details about those technologies into informational or instructional content for them.  I'd bring that perspective to development, and I'd be able to better bridge the gap between building and teaching people what you built, why you built it, and how they can use it.  
<br>
I took the job that I have now because my current manager convinced me I'd be able to do this: I planned to revisit my very vague memories of R from grad school and teach myself to use Python to find repeating n-grams in our content.  I wanted to use Python to find repeating and/or similar phrases, organize them, and increase reuse across our documentation in order to improve it.  This hasn't panned out, so I want to take a different approach in order to achieve a similar goal in a year or three.  With a strong foundation in coding, I think I'd be able to find better positions where ideas like this are actually entertained past the interview stage.  I’d have the resources to know where to start and what/how to learn.  And, if I'm wrong about returning to something content-oriented, I'll have a great skillset that I can use to pivot to another career trajectory that will satisfy the analytical and creative parts of my brain.
<br>
From a more personal perspective, I also would bring a different background to development than I think many do.  I was raised female, I'm queer, and I have a long background in the humanities.  I approach problems by making connections because that's what I've learned socially and academically, and I think that would make me a good developer.
